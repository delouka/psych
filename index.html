      While many substances like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide">LSD</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin">psilocybin</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA">MDMA</a> are usually followed with statements such as “have no medical use”, many researchers have a great scientific interest in their use. 
      After decades of stigma, psychiatric interest in psychedelic drugs is resurging. Some evidence shows certain psychedelic drugs could be an essential tool in exploring the parts of the mind that are usually inaccessible. 
      <br><br>
      What are these drugs, and how can they help us understand and treat mental illness? <b>Let's take a trip...</b>

          <td class='col-sm-9 serif'><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide">LSD</a> is a synthetic chemical derived from ergot. It has been used in treatments for anxiety, depression, psychosomatic diseases, and addiction. Studies show LSD can help the brain grow cells and form new connections in regions that typically exhibit cell death from mental disorders. The strongest evidence is in the use of LSD as a treatment for alcoholism. LSD could help reveal the biochemical bases for mental illness and improve the understanding of consciousness.</td>

It acts on pathways in the brain that involve the use of the neurotransmitter serotonin. While research on the use of psilocybin-assisted therapy is still ongoing, a 2016 study linked it to a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression in people going through cancer treatment.

        <tr> 
          <td class='col-sm-9 serif'><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine">Ketamine</a> has traditionally been used as an anesthetic and an analgesic, but has been found to treat chemical imbalances of glutamate and GABA which can cause depression. Phase 1 of treatment includes activating the brain’s opiate receptors causing patients to feel relaxed, free from pain, and sedated. Phase 2 increases glutamate receptors which helps rebalance the levels of glutamate and GABA. Phase 3 occurs after the levels are stabilized and the brain’s reaction to Ketamine causes new neural receptors to grow which can “reset” the depressed brain. Ketamine can be especially useful for patients whose depression involves suicidal thoughts.
            <br><br>
            In 2019 esketamine, a ketamine-based drug, was approved by the FDA in 2019 to treat depression, becoming the first depression treatment approved by the FDA in decades. Because ketamine is already FDA approved for anesthetic use, doctors can utilize it off-label to treat depression.

Before becoming a schedule 1 drug it was used by some psychology professionals to help patients that struggled with communication feel more relaxed and open to talking about their problems.

  <h2>Where did the stigma come from? </h2>

Initial research involving LSD in the 1950’s showed great potential. Then, LSD became the drug of choice for ‘hippies’ in 1960’s counterculture. LSD, and psychedelics as a whole, took on negative connotations due to the messages of anarchy and protest associated with the countercultural movement. 

<br><br>
Psychedelic drugs became largely connected to insanity, self-harm, and antiauthoritarianism. These factors did not play well for psychedelics’ reputation, regardless of the suggested effects on mental illness. For decades, the media and US federal government has largely portrayed psychedelics as extremely dangerous drugs. However, based on research, the classic serotonergic psychedelics are generally considered very physiologically safe, especially compared with opiates and psychostimulants (Nichols).
<br><br>
In the video below, Ram Dass, then known as Dr. Richard Alpert, discusses the effects of LSD on the psyche. Dass was fired along with Timothy Leary in 1963 for giving LSD to undergraduate students. LSD was evangelized by Dass and Leary, with Leary telling people to “turn on, tune in, drop out,” a phrase that became popular within the counterculture.<br><br>

<br><br>
Many researchers feel the therapeutic benefits of psychedelics are undeniable. But the unpredictable nature of the psychedelic experience coupled with the stigma of recreational drug use have made incorporating them into Western medicine problematic.

  <h2>Are psychedelics safe? </h2>
  <br>
  <p class='serif'>
    Although there is a public perception that psychedelic drugs are dangerous, from a physiological standpoint they are one of the safest known classes of CNS drugs. They do not lead to dependence or addiction, and no overdose deaths have occurred after ingestion of typical doses of LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline (Nichols).<br><br>

  <h2>How can the stigma be addressed? </h2>
  <br>
  <p class='serif'> 
    Recently, there have been global efforts to reduce the stigma associated with psychedelic therapy. There are over 100 research trials today acting to protect this form of therapy, including those in the Netherlands, which contains many psychedelic therapy centers. It is believed that the more we are educated on the subject, the less of a negative perception we will have on psychedelics. There is hope that the more we know about the field of psychedelics, the less of a negative perception our society will have on the therapy, like the reduction of the stigma of other drugs. The Therapeutic Goods Association, Australia's medicine and therapeutic regulatory agency, recently agreed to reducing specific psychedelics from category 9 to category 8 drugs. This makes the drugs in question controlled, rather than prohibited. 
    <br><br>
      The importance of reducing the stigma comes down to the positive impact it can have on those who are mentally ill. If the therapy has a significant outcome on those who have a mental disorder, the results from the reduction of this stigma will have a positive impact. It is important to be open to new discoveries in the psychedelic realm due to the lack of previous knowledge we have on the subject. The opinions formed on psychedelic therapy are due to these negative stigmas and not based on actual data. Once the data is presented, the prior reduction of the stigma will allow for a more fluid transition, and less of a sense of guilt for those in need.
